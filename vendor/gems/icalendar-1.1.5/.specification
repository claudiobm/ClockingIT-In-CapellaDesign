description: |-
  This is a Ruby library for dealing with iCalendar files.  Rather than
  explaining myself, here is the introduction from RFC-2445, which
  defines the format:
  
  The use of calendaring and scheduling has grown considerably in the
  last decade. Enterprise and inter-enterprise business has become
  dependent on rapid scheduling of events and actions using this
  information technology. However, the longer term growth of calendaring
  and scheduling, is currently limited by the lack of Internet standards
  for the message content types that are central to these knowledgeware
  applications. This memo is intended to progress the level of
  interoperability possible between dissimilar calendaring and
  scheduling applications. This memo defines a MIME content type for
  exchanging electronic calendaring and scheduling information. The
  Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification, or
  iCalendar, allows for the capture and exchange of information normally
  stored within a calendaring and scheduling application; such as a
  Personal Information Manager (PIM) or a Group Scheduling product. 
  
  The iCalendar format is suitable as an exchange format between
  applications or systems. The format is defined in terms of a MIME
  content type. This will enable the object to be exchanged using
  several transports, including but not limited to SMTP, HTTP, a file
  system, desktop interactive protocols such as the use of a memory-
  based clipboard or drag/drop interactions, point-to-point asynchronous
  communication, wired-network transport, or some form of unwired
  transport such as infrared might also be used.
